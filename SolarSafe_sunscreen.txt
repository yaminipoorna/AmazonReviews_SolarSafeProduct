  Best sunscreen you will find if you have a problem of sun damage or have a sensitive skin.I wasnt able to wear sunscreen because it would block my skin and it couldn't breathe. And so I ended up having a lot of sun damage, my skin is super sensitive to sun. Freckles, brown spots, rashes, this sunscreen became my saviour. My doctor prescribed it to me at first and gave me a sample to try and boy am I thankful to her for that.This product was so good that I also ended up trying its other products that are mentioned in the pamphlet that comes along in box. And to my delight I found a great serum and the best night moituriser. So thank you Regaliz.

Then I was little bit disappointedLets see the resultIts been 1 n half monthsI m using this sunscreen daily means daily.N just WOWI have bought nutrigena sunscreen also but gave it to my sister n started using this.A must buy sunscreenM going to buy it again as i have used it all.But i hope i will get cream packed with seal this time, this is the only flaws i got.

  Apart from its protecting abilities, the sunscreen has an amazing texture which I absolutely loved. It's not too rough, not too silicone-y, just perfectly smooth to glide on your skin. It gets absorbed in seconds, with no oily or sweaty feeling. Also leaves no white cast. Much much better than the La Sheild one in terms of application. Amazing find! Try it for sure.

  This is the best ever product I have tried till data. I would like to thank Amazon for delivering it on time, excellent delivery experience. The sunscreen came seal packed. This is amazing product. It is good for sensetive skin and even oily skin. It contains vitamin c and vitamin e which provides moisture and instant brighter skin. It has spf 50 which gives sun protection for a good 5-7 hours. It has sheerness, does not leave any white cast after application . It is waterproof as well, amazing product. For me it worth 5 stars. I am writing my first review on Amazon because of the product quantity and timely delivery.

  This is the best ever product I have tried till data. I would like to thank Amazon for delivering it on time, excellent delivery experience. The sunscreen came seal packed. This is amazing product. It is good for sensetive skin and even oily skin. It contains vitamin c and vitamin e which provides moisture and instant brighter skin. It has spf 50 which gives sun protection for a good 5-7 hours. It has sheerness, does not leave any white cast after application . It is waterproof as well, amazing product. For me it worth 5 stars. I am writing my first review on Amazon because of the product quantity and timely delivery.

  Best sunscreen you will find if you have a problem of sun damage or have a sensitive skin.I wasnt able to wear sunscreen because it would block my skin and it couldn't breathe. And so I ended up having a lot of sun damage, my skin is super sensitive to sun. Freckles, brown spots, rashes, this sunscreen became my saviour. My doctor prescribed it to me at first and gave me a sample to try and boy am I thankful to her for that.This product was so good that I also ended up trying its other products that are mentioned in the pamphlet that comes along in box. And to my delight I found a great serum and the best night moituriser. So thank you Regaliz.

  Its good lightweight n non greasy.But I m just wandering there was no aluminum seal and also when I open it at first I had to press 2-3 times to get the cream.... Then I was little bit disappointedLets see the resultIts been 1 n half monthsI m using this sunscreen daily means daily.N just WOWI have bought nutrigena sunscreen also but gave it to my sister n started using this.A must buy sunscreenM going to buy it again as i have used it all.But i hope i will get cream packed with seal this time, this is the only flaws i got.

  Apart from its protecting abilities, the sunscreen has an amazing texture which I absolutely loved. It's not too rough, not too silicone-y, just perfectly smooth to glide on your skin. It gets absorbed in seconds, with no oily or sweaty feeling. Also leaves no white cast. Much much better than the La Sheild one in terms of application. Amazing find! Try it for sure.

  Apart from its protecting abilities, the sunscreen has an amazing texture which I absolutely loved. It's not too rough, not too silicone-y, just perfectly smooth to glide on your skin. It gets absorbed in seconds, with no oily or sweaty feeling. Also leaves no white cast. Much much better than the La Sheild one in terms of application. Amazing find! Try it for sure.

  This is the best ever product I have tried till data. I would like to thank Amazon for delivering it on time, excellent delivery experience. The sunscreen came seal packed. This is amazing product. It is good for sensetive skin and even oily skin. It contains vitamin c and vitamin e which provides moisture and instant brighter skin. It has spf 50 which gives sun protection for a good 5-7 hours. It has sheerness, does not leave any white cast after application . It is waterproof as well, amazing product. For me it worth 5 stars. I am writing my first review on Amazon because of the product quantity and timely delivery.

  Best sunscreen you will find if you have a problem of sun damage or have a sensitive skin.I wasnt able to wear sunscreen because it would block my skin and it couldn't breathe. And so I ended up having a lot of sun damage, my skin is super sensitive to sun. Freckles, brown spots, rashes, this sunscreen became my saviour. My doctor prescribed it to me at first and gave me a sample to try and boy am I thankful to her for that.This product was so good that I also ended up trying its other products that are mentioned in the pamphlet that comes along in box. And to my delight I found a great serum and the best night moituriser. So thank you Regaliz.

  This is really a excellent and must have sunscreen. Very light and doesn’t feel anything on your skin. Easily absorbed, doesn’t leave any white cast. I must recommend to all sunscreen lover to must buy this product which has ended my search for a good sunscreen.Thanks Regaliz and Amazon.
